This works well, but due to sequential invoice numbers and batch submissions of invoices, can trigger thousands of false positives that need to be reviewed manually. We've adopted 3 strategies to alleviate this: 1) Refinement, a threshold-based system that kicks off when a chain of duplicates grows too large, indicating a long running sequence or batch and applies stricter matching levels. 2) Semantic Break requirement: we use Chromadb to do a semantic comparison and reject matches below a given threshold, 3)LLM based review: We pass the final results to qwen running on our ollama server to do an automated review of the surviving matches, identifying likely true matches, and false positives. This also allows us to handle close matches between unrelated vendors and close matches between known subsidiaries or dbas. We are still in the prototyping phase using manual submissions to test and validate the system. The final component will be hooking our financial systems into a pipeline to run the job automatically and forward the results to our finance team for auditing.\n\nAll of the duplication server logic is purposely kept generic with thresholds and llm rules being passed as a parameter. The fields are categorized using an llm, and the results are used by the deduplication server to determine the best parameters for composite key generation in the bucketing process. This means the job could easily be rebuilt to do other duplication detection, such as duplicate service ticket submissions by copying the N8N pipeline and making minor configuration changes. We've built an MCP server to allow monitoring the server and even running smaller duplicate detection jobs directly from Claude code for rapid prototyping.",

By reviewing the process steps, we identified several steps that can be supported by different prompts, then staggered them for an \"almost\" automated workflow.  The \"almost\" allows users to adjust the prompts along the way for minor adjustments that may be appropriate for their needs.  User uploads data and the system prompting serves as the mentor role, first by providing a quick summary of the available data.  Then the users loads a series of prompts within the same discussion to explore opportunities, possible response actions, personas to test the ideas, action items and timelines, and communication templates for moving forward.",

    "description": "Some users are used to buttons and dropdowns, so can we use that mindset to help them learn about prompt engineering?  We created a proof of concept within Excel that would allow a user to choose from dropdowns, then a concatenate formula would provide two outputs.  One could be pasted into AI which would provide a single prompt and then the AI would attempt to provide the response.  The second, when pasted into an AI, would provide several examples of prompts for the user to select from.  This idea was super rough and didn't get implemented, but I still believe there are users for whom this would be helpful.  I envision this with a web interface or within an app (maybe even within the AI UI) with additional button options or switches for an intuitive or familiar feel.  I will provide the link.  You will need to download the file to interact with the fields.  Please let me know if you find this useful and especially if you take the idea any further along.
