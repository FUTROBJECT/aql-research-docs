# Navigator v2 Content — Progress

## Voice Analysis (v1 Navigator) — COMPLETE
2026-02-21 — Cataloged all user-facing copy from v1 index.html. Key findings:

**Hero Headlines:** Short, declarative, line-break rhythm. "Navigate AI. Designed for your college." / "Nine pillars. Ten gaps. Fourteen templates." / "Here's where to start." All under 10 words per line. Possessive "your" throughout.

**Stat Strip:** Number + short phrase. Dramatic juxtaposition: "224 Frameworks Researched / 10 CC Gaps Identified / 0 Existing Frameworks Filling Them." The zero is the punchline.

**Pillar Principles:** One sentence, italic, states the standard as a declaration. Uses em-dash interruptions for emphasis: "Humans — not algorithms — make consequential decisions." Parallel structure across all 9.

**Scorecard Questions:** Direct question to "you" or "the vendor." Always starts with the actionable query. "What specific student outcome does this tool serve? Can you name it?"

**"What You're Looking For" Guidance:** Starts with the answer, then explains why. "A concrete answer tied to learning, completion, transfer, or career readiness — not 'operational efficiency' or 'innovation.'" Negation as clarification.

**Scoring Rubrics:** Parallel grammar across 3/2/1. The "3" describes the ideal. The "1" uses the same structure to describe the failure. Reader feels the gap through symmetry.

**Source Notes:** Framework citations in compact format. Collapsed/expandable.

**Callout Boxes / Provisions:** Instructions, not commentary. "Write an AI policy statement." "Conduct an AI inventory." Verb-first imperative.

**No-Go Lines:** Short declarative. "Students are not training data." "Decisions without recourse are not governance." No explanation needed — the line speaks for itself.

**Functional Headers:** "What You Need" / "Start With These Pillars" / "Your Next Step" / "Your First Templates." Never abstract ("Understanding Your Risk Profile"). Always concrete ("Here's where to start.").

**Archetype Cards:** First-person plural: "We're Just Getting Started" / "We Have Too Many Initiatives" / "We Need Equity Guardrails" / "We're Building AI In."

**Loading/Transition Copy:** "Building your governance profile" / "Analyzing your answers against 224 frameworks…"

**CTAs:** Action verbs + possessive: "Take the Assessment" / "View Your Roadmap" / "Explore Framework"

## Rewiring America Analysis — COMPLETE
2026-02-21 — Fetched and analyzed rewiringamerica.org/go-electric.

**Journey Framing:** "Your journey begins here" / "no matter where you are on your electric journey, we've got you covered." Transforms a technical decision into a personal progression. Users see themselves advancing through stages.

**Benefits-First:** Lead with outcomes before mechanics. "Lower bills, comfier home, healthier planet." / "save you an average of $898 per year." Specific dollar amounts, not vague promises.

**Triads:** "Step-by-step guides, free tools, and world-class resources." Three-part lists feel complete and memorable. Matching rhythm aids retention.

**Tool-Does-the-Work:** "Generate a free, personalized electrification plan in just a few minutes." / "Our guides make it easy to complete electric upgrades." Intelligence/work shifts to platform; user role becomes selection/approval.

**Warmth + Credibility:** Casual voice ("btw," / "memes, too!") coexists with hard numbers ("Billions in federal rebates"). Personal stories (David, a California dad). The effect: approachable expertise, not intimidating authority.

## Voice Synthesis — COMPLETE
2026-02-21 — v2 voice is WARM AND BLUNT. The same person from v1, but they learned something from Rewiring America about meeting people where they are.

**From v1 (keep):** Sharp anchor lines. Concrete specificity. Functional headers. Parallel rubric structure. Direct "you" address. No hedging. Names tools, regulations, institutions. Verb-first instructions.

**From Rewiring America (adopt):** Journey framing (map, not audit). Benefits-first ordering. Triads for hooks. Tool-does-the-work positioning. Warmth signals.

**DO NOT adopt from Rewiring America:** Puns. Consumer marketing energy. General-public reading level. Casual internet voice ("btw").

**The v2 balance:**
- Start warm, land blunt: "Know where you're strong and where students need protection."
- Journey framing replaces compliance framing: "The Navigator is a map, not a test."
- No-go lines stay sharp but framed supportively: "These are the lines. Everything else, we can work with."
- The tool does the work: "Answer a few questions. Get a governance roadmap tailored to your institution."
- Audience is VPSSs, deans, IT directors, faculty leaders — smart, busy, skeptical.

**Test sentence:** If someone read v1 and v2 side by side, they should sound like the same person. v2 is slightly warmer at the door, equally blunt when it matters.
